# Changelog

All notable changes to BugDrop will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.11.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Rate limiting**: API now includes rate limiting to prevent spam and protect GitHub API quotas. Limits: 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP, 50 requests per hour per repository. Returns `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header when exceeded.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Feedback categories**: Users can now select a category (Bug 🐛, Feature ✨, or Question ❓) when submitting feedback. Categories are mapped to GitHub labels (`bug`, `enhancement`, `question`) for easy triage.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Automatic browser/OS detection**: The widget now automatically captures and parses browser name/version and OS name/version from the user agent string. This information is displayed in a collapsible "System Info" section on the GitHub issue for easier debugging.
- **Enhanced system metadata**: Issues now include viewport size with device pixel ratio, browser language, and cleaner formatting in a markdown table.

### Changed
- **URL privacy**: URLs are now automatically redacted to remove query parameters and hash fragments, protecting potentially sensitive data while still providing useful page context.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- Fixed animation timing issue where dismiss animation could be interrupted.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Directional animations for dismiss/restore**: When dismissing the feedback pill, it now smoothly slides out to the right. When restoring via the pull tab, it slides in from the right. This creates a polished, intuitive flow that matches the spatial direction of the action.

### Changed
- Dismiss animation uses `animationend` event to properly sequence DOM removal after the slide-out completes.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Custom accent color**: Set `data-color="#FF6B35"` to customize the widget's accent color to match your app's design. The color is applied to the trigger button, focus rings, and other accent elements.
- **Dismiss duration**: Set `data-dismiss-duration="7"` to have the dismissed button reappear after 7 days. Without this, dismissed buttons stay hidden forever.
- **Pull tab restore**: After dismissing the button, a subtle pull tab appears on the screen edge so users can easily restore the full button. Disable with `data-show-restore="false"`.

### Changed
- `show()` API method now clears the dismissed state, allowing you to programmatically bring back a button that was dismissed by the user.
- Dismissed state now stores a timestamp instead of a boolean, enabling the new duration feature. Legacy `'true'` values are still honored for backwards compatibility.
- Non-dismissible widgets now automatically clear stale dismissed state from localStorage, ensuring the button always shows.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- **JavaScript API**: Programmatic control via `window.BugDrop`:
  - `open()` / `close()` - Control the feedback modal
  - `hide()` / `show()` - Control the floating button visibility
  - `isOpen()` / `isButtonVisible()` - Query current state
- **API-only mode**: Set `data-button="false"` to hide the floating button and trigger feedback only via the JavaScript API
- **Ready event**: `bugdrop:ready` event fires when the API is available

### Changed
- **Feedback pill design**: The trigger button is now a pill showing "🐛 Feedback" instead of a circular icon, making it clearer what the button does.
- **Improved feedback flow**: The widget now shows a welcome screen first, explaining what the feedback tool does. Users then fill out their feedback with an optional checkbox to include a screenshot. This makes the flow more intuitive and allows text-only feedback without the screenshot step.
- **Smooth entry animations**: The feedback pill and pull tab now slide in with smooth animations when they appear.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- **Dismissible floating button**: Users can now dismiss the feedback button by clicking an X icon that appears on hover. The preference is saved to localStorage and persists across page loads. Enable with `data-button-dismissible="true"`.
- **Versioned widget URLs**: Pin your widget to specific versions for stability:
  - `/widget.js` - Always latest (auto-updates)
  - `/widget.v1.js` - Pinned to major version 1.x
  - `/widget.v1.1.js` - Pinned to minor version 1.1.x
  - `/widget.v1.1.0.js` - Pinned to exact version
- **Release-based deployment**: Publishing a GitHub Release now automatically deploys to Cloudflare Workers. This gives maintainers explicit control over when updates reach users.
- **Versions manifest**: `/versions.json` endpoint shows available versions.

### Changed
- Build process now generates versioned widget bundles automatically.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- Initial release of BugDrop widget.
- **Screenshot capture**: Full page or specific element screenshots.
- **Annotation tools**: Draw, arrow, and rectangle tools for highlighting issues.
- **Element picker**: Click to select specific page elements for feedback.
- **GitHub integration**: Automatic issue creation via GitHub App.
- **Theme support**: Light, dark, and auto (system preference) themes.
- **Position options**: Bottom-right or bottom-left button placement.
- **Submitter info**: Optional name and email collection (`data-show-name`, `data-require-name`, `data-show-email`, `data-require-email`).
- **Shadow DOM isolation**: Widget styles don't conflict with host page.
- **Private repo support**: Works with both public and private repositories.
